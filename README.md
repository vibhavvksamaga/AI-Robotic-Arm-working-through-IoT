# AI-Robotic-Arm-working-through-IoT
This project was made for a 24hr National Hackathon. It essentially involves and AI Robotic arm that works on the principle of using OpenCV to map your hand motions and translate that onto the Actual physical robotic arm. Along with this, it has a very important built in feature of IoT enabling us to control this robotic arm anywhere .
