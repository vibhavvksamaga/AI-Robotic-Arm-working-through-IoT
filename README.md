# AI-Robotic-Arm-working-through-IoT
This project was made for a 24hr National Hackathon. It essentially involves and AI Robotic arm that works on the principle of using OpenCV to map your hand motions and translate that onto the Actual physical robotic arm. Along with this, it has a very important built in feature of IoT enabling us to control this robotic arm anywhere .
It also has another feature of a record play back function where it records the movements of the robotic arm and has a function to play it back over and over again.
The applications are numereous from industrial robotic labour to telemetry surgeries.
I have attatched the models done on Fusion 360 autodesk as well as the Python codes required to be run.
Materials : Arduino , Switches, Servo x 3, Nylon Badminton strings.
